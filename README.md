# YouTube Command-Line Downloader

A simple tool to download video or audio from YouTube directly from your terminal.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)

That's it! FFmpeg will be installed automatically.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    If you've downloaded this from GitHub, navigate into the project folder.

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run this command. It will install all necessary libraries, including FFmpeg.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(This step might take a bit longer as it's downloading a ~70MB FFmpeg file).*
